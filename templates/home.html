<p>Here is a quote from <cite><abbr title="the magnus archives">TMA</abbr></cite>, particualr the episode <mark>DIG</mark></p>

<blockquote cite="https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/">
Perhaps they sensed it, that need inside of us. Above us, you see, there’s only the sky, the infinite, a void of space and emptiness so incredible that to think of it in detail is to overwhelm the mind. But down, down into the earth. Through the many layers of this globe, this sphere built and crusted upon a single, beating point. The centre of the universe for each and every one of us, that glorious convergence from which everything, everywhere, is ‘up’. To reach it, to approach that source, that rolling, molten centre of it all, the only thing you have to do is <mark>dig</mark>.
